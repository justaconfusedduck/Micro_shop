### Your New Developer Workflow

Now, instead of running six separate `python` commands, your entire backend can be managed with one command.

1.  **Prerequisite:** Make sure you have **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your computer.
2.  **Start the Backend:** Open a single terminal, navigate to your `/backend` folder, and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The first time you run this, it will take a few minutes to build the Docker image. Afterwards, it will be much faster. You will see the logs from all six services interleaved in this one terminal window.
3.  **Start the Frontend:** Open a *second* terminal, navigate to your `/frontend` folder, and run the React server as usual:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
